# Forecasting the spread of COVID-19 using deep learning
Dissertation for BSc Mathematics at the University of York, entailing original research, training a LSTM and GCN architectures in order to forecast the spread of COVID-19 across the USA.

Final results favoured the LSTM model and proved potential use cases for time-series forecasting, however it suggested that statistical methods such as ARIMA reign dominant in approximating the spread of disease.
